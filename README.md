# elypt's dotfiles

Inspired by [geerlingguy's dotfiles](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles), this is my own modified version for my Mac Studio and Macbook. ZSH Config, paths, aliases, and a few other things are synced through Fig.

Combined with [Mac Development Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook), it sets up a Mac from scratch.
